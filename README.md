**burstah** is a build monitor for [Go.CD](http://go.cd) based on [node.js](http://nodejs.org).
It is a refreshed implementation of [cidar](https://github.com/patforna/cidar).

###To run is just do following:

```
   git clone https://github.com/lplotni/burstah.git
   cd burstah
   npm install
   nohup npm start &
```
###To configure
Open config.js and add the url of your GO server as well as the stages you would
like to show. The stucture of the config.js is pretty straight-forrward:

```
var config = {
    hostname: '127.0.0.1', //IP or host the Go server is running on
    port: '8153',
    auth: '', //user:password if Go is using simple auth
    limitTo: [ 'pipeline_name :: stage_name :: job_name', 'bbb :: zzz :: aaa' ] //array with all the stages you would like to show, if empty everything will be shown
    }
  };
```
###To improve
If you're used to node.js and express.js than you should be able to quickly navigate, through the code. The projects uses [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) for build automation.

####Tests
As we use gulp, we use gulp-jasmine for test execution. All the tests can be found in the spec folder. To run them just enter
```
gulp test
```

####CSS
We use [sass](http://sass-lang.com/) instead of pure css. The files can be
found in **public/stylesheets**. CSS will be generated by compass, just run
following gulp task:
```
gulp compass
```

####Go.cd API
If you want to work with Go APIs, you find the needed documentation here: [Go API docs](http://www.thoughtworks.com/products/docs/go/current/help/go_api.html)

####Fake Go.Cd Server
If you want to work on new features without running or communitcating with a real Go instance, you can just start the fake Go which can be found in the *fakeGo* directory.
````gulp fakeGo````
If you develop and start burstah locally using gulp, then fakeGo will be
started automaticaly.
FakeGo is a simple sinatra-based app which offers the cctray.xml and is accessible via http://localhost:4567
